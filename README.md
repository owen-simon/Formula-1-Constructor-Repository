# Formula-1-Constructor-Repository

# Data Description
This dataset contains constructor level seasonal performance data from the Formula One World Championship beginning in 1992 to present.

The 1992 season was selected as the starting point because it represents the first year in which each constructor consistently entered exactly two cars per race, allowing constructor level performance to be evaluated on a standardized competitive basis.

Each observation represents a single constructor lineage competing in a given season, regardless of branding or naming changes over time.

Constructor branding continuity and driver transitions were cross referenced using the Formula 1 Lineage Project:
