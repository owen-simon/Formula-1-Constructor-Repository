# Formula-1-Constructor-Repository

## Data Description
This dataset contains constructor level seasonal performance data from the Formula One World Championship beginning in 2002 to present.

The 2002 season was selected as the starting point because it represents the first year in which all competing constructors are consistently listed in official championship standings published by the Formula One Group.

## Data Sources

Seasonal constructor entry and results data were collected from official championship records published by the Formula One Group:

Constructor branding continuity, ownership transitions, and historical lineage relationships were compiled using documentation from the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile in conjunction with the Formula 1 Lineage Project:

The Formula 1 Lineage Project was used to assist in identifying organizational continuity across constructor name and licensing changes (for example Tyrrell → BAR → Honda → Brawn GP → Mercedes), allowing performance to be tracked at the ownership and operational level rather than by team branding alone.
