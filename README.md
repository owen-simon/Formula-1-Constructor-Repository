# Formula-1-Constructor-Repository

## Data Description
This dataset contains constructor-level seasonal performance data from the Formula One World Championship, from 2002 to the present.

The 2002 season was selected as the starting point because it represents the first year in which all competing constructors are consistently listed in the official championship standings published by the Formula One Group.

The purpose of this data is to predict the winner of the Formula One Constructor's Championship. The target variable is `Constructor_Champion`.

## Data Sources

Seasonal constructor entry and results data were collected from official championship records published by the Formula One Group:
